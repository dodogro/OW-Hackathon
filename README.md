# HackAtOW - Team: No R-egrets 

The following text serves to purpose of guiding intuitively the viewer throughout our codes and analyses. Moreover, it is highly recommended to follow the prescribed order to have a flawlessly running code. 

- The first file named "Data Cleaning" has been designed in order to address all the problems related to misspelled data entries, peculiar numbers, errors, etc. In few words, it has to be ran as first script so as to have for the following analyses cleaned data. The script is subdivided into "chunks" each of them commented thoroghly to make the viewer understand what ouor thoughts have been and the assumptions that have been made. 

- The second notebook is intuitevely designed to the second task of understanding the relative performances. 

- The third script is where the Machine Learning (ML) tasks has been performed. 

- Lastly, we have decided to add an extra script we thought it might have been of interest of our client, namely one containing an interactive Dashboard. This can be used to have a direct yet interactive understanding of all the aspects that our client would be willing to monitor.
