# HackAtOW - Team: No R-egrets 

The following text serves to the purpose of guiding intuitively the viewer throughout our codes and analyses. Moreover, it is highly recommended to follow the prescribed order to have a flawlessly running code. 

- The first file named "Data Cleaning" has been designed in order to address all the problems related to misspelled data entries, peculiar numbers, errors, outliers, etc. In few words, it has to be ran as FIRST SCRIPT so as to have for the following analyses the proper, cleaned, data. The script is subdivided into "chunks" each of them commented thoroghly to make the viewer understand what our thoughts have been and the assumptions that have been made. 

- The second notebook, EDA ("Exploratory Data Analysis") has been designed to answer to the first two tasks related to the explorative part of the data set. 

- Strictly connected to the previous script, we have prepared an ad-hoc script "Summary Statistics" which, as the name suggest, serves to prpose of collecting in few codes-lines the requested statistics. 

- The third script, "Baseline Prediction" is where the forecasting task has been performed. 

- Lastly, we have decided to add an extra script we thought it might have been of interest of our client, namely one containing an interactive Dashboard ("Dashboard"). This can be used to have a direct yet interactive understanding of all the aspects that our client would be willing to monitor. 

NOTE: Due to the immense data frames size it is not possible to send the data along with the scripts in one single folder. Thus, to avoid any problems with the code we hihgly recommend to create two separate folders: 
1) "Data-OW"
2) Folder containing all the lines of codes and the PPT. 

&rarr; We will send a zip.file already containing the two folders, namely an EMPTY "Data-OW" and an "OW-Hackathon". We will kindly ask to full the former with all the data sets we have received at the start of the challenge in order to allow the script to understand all the directories and read the data without incurring in any errors.
